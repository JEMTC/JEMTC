						<header><h2> Rationale </h2></header>
						<section class="content-format shadow">
						<p>When it comes to creating the client site as well as the proto-site, here is a list of components that we considered for a successful website:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Site layout - A simple and clean layout to generate a user-friendly page. A search bar is intended for assisting students to find information quickly and easily. </li>
						<li>Navigation menu - We decided to go with a 3-column page layout. The most important navigation is on the left (most conventional): lectures, homework and important information about the course. Having fixed positioning here would of been ideal, but we were unable to execute this. The bcit links and validation is less important, so we put that on the right. We've included "back to top" links at the bottom of the lectures, and a search bar, for easy navigation. </li>
						
						<li>Pages - We decided to give "course outline" and "homework" their own pages. We thought that both contain important information, and wanted to separate them from the weekly lectures. Students may refere back to the course outline on a regular basis. Students are also always concerned about their homework, and need a place to quickly jump too it. </li>

						<li>INC files - We replaced weekly lecture material, navigation, footer, and banner by using SSI coding to include INC files. The instructor would just need to upload new lecture material on a INC file with SSI coding for easy implementation and management.</li>
						<li>Images display - We utilized FancyBox for an elegant way to display images.</li>
						<li>Tone - A welcoming page for students, prospective students, alumni and the instructor. Simple, clean design makes for easy reading, and navigating.</li>
						<li>Style - We are aiming to achieve a sleek contemporary look rather than a retro look.  As the site contains new lectures regarding web technology that is constantly changing, a modern look is more suitable.  </li>
						<li>Typography - We picked contemporary fonts to resemble the look and feel of client page as well as client project page. </li>
						<li>Relationship - We made sure the design relates to the company’s personality, values and goals. Although you may think that a design is great, if the client can’t relate to it, or if it doesn’t represent the company well, the design is unsuccessful. Our site is successful in terms of relating the students/instructor to the COMP1950 class because it's goal is to find information quickly and easily. We've achieved this by the simplicity and cleanliness of the site. </li>
				<li>Colours - For our client page, we choose orange, grey and white as the primary colours because orange is eye-catching, refreshing but not too intense (like red). Grey and white compliment the orange and tones it down very well.  For our proto-site,  navy, white and grey are utilized as the primary colours. We chose this because the navy, grey and white resemble the colours being used on the BCIT’s website.  Thus, students can associate the COMP1950 class with BCIT.  </li>
						<li>Symbolism -  The "Comp1950 Student Page" logo reflects the color scheme of the BCIT home page, so students can relate to the class / school. The graphic of the pencil represents taking notes / lectures - because this is the purpose of the site. The logo is portrayed in the clean, modern and simple way - the goals of our site. </li>
